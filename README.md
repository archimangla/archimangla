## 🧠 About Me

I build backend systems focused on correctness, consistency, and real-world reliability.

- Strong foundation in DSA, DBMS, OS, and REST architecture  
- Interested in concurrency control, atomic operations, and system design  
- Active internship contributor building production-grade tools  
- Coding in C++ with structured DSA practice  

I care more about system behavior under edge cases than just passing test cases.
